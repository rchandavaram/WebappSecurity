# WebappSecurity
Security layer preventing all web application vulnerabilities
Going to add interfaces followed by implementations.
added interfaces to design flow.
Step1: Find machine learning algo to use.
Step2: Run the algo based on input and find out different attacks possible.
Step3: sanitize input request and/or terminate the flow with fail fast method.

will implement some of attacks in coming days.
